<h1 id="#desc-wrapper">Sydney Best Beaches</h1>
<p>When you think of Australia, there’s one thing that comes to mind: drop bears. But, really, you can’t imagine the land down under without picturing beautiful blue ocean and breathtaking sandy beaches. To help you make the most of Sydney’s summer, we’ve put together an insider’s guide to the best beaches: from the most popular beaches to the hidden coves.</p>
<p>Fortunately, many of our best beaches can be reached easily by public transport, making them super travel-friendly for tourists or beach-goers without a car. When heading to the beach, remember to always swim between the flags and listen to lifeguards. If it’s an unpatrolled beach, you can keep up to date on conditions by visiting Beach Safe for the latest info. And don’t forget to slip, slop, slap with an SPF 50+ sunscreen to avoid the dreaded sunburn. Now, on with the list!</p>   
<p>It doesn’t get more iconic than this. One kilometre of golden sand, endless waves, a stunning oceanside pool and a bustling promenade just metres from the beach. What more could you want? If you’re happy to put up with the masses, this tourist’s paradise is worth a visit – and can be reached by a quick bus ride from Bondi Junction train station.</p>
